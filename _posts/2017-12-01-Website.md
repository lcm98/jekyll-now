Summary: This very website is a project in and of itself. My goal in creating it is to host a blog for any topics I want to discuss, to host a portfolio of sorts, and to learn in the process.

This website is built ontop of the <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll-Now project</a> and host via GitHub Pages. By starting from a template I deconstructed and learned how Jekyll works (it turns out to be fairly straight forward and uses Ruby), and rebuilt the site to fit my purposes using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The downside of GitHub Pages is that it doesn't allow server side code. Therefore the next steps of developement of the website are to move the hosting to a cloud service such as AWS to enable me to expand the uses of the website (such as including live demos of models). The process of moving to the cloud, will be a great chance for me to gain more exposure to all the steps involed web hosting, as well as provide a test bed for future web projects.
