Summary: Used feature engineering with the Ames Housing Dataset to predict the expected value of houses in Ames, Iowa.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses. I was tasked with creating two models to predict different targets, being a regression problem to predict the price of a house at sale, and a classification problem predicting whether a house sale was abnormal or not.
