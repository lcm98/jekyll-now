Summary: Integrated financial information from the Alpha Vantage API into a neural network built using TensorFlowâ€™s Python library to predict the S&P 500 closing stock price on the following day.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses. I was tasked with creating two models to predict different targets, being a regression problem to predict the price of a house at sale, and a classification problem predicting whether a house sale was abnormal or not.
