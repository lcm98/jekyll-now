Summary: Creating an application with a partner that enhances the native Twitch functionality for both Streamers and Viewers.

Currently I'm working on a C# application using the .NET Framework with a group of friends for the streaming site Twitch.tv that enhances the native Twitch functionality for both Streamers and Viewers, aiming to solve the problem of Streamers needing to use multiple bots to achieve desired features.

The application is designed to have a service oriented architecture, and therefore is built with concurrency in mind. It currently in an alpha state, so that we can perform testing in actual real world usage. It features dashboards with more detailed analytics than Twitch provides; loyalty points to drive viewing; and Twitch IRC chatbot integration for viewer interaction through music queuing, polls, betting, and custom commands.

My duties have included building out relational database using Microsoft SQL and backend feature development in C# using the .NET Framework. I am currently working on integrating Twitter information, in order to add depth to our loyalty point system, and integrate tweets with on screen overlays. Additionally, I have been working to familiarize myself with the ASP.NET MVC Web Framework, so that I can better contribute to the front end functions of the web development as well.
