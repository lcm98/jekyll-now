	  <p>For the last four months I’ve been taking an immersive Data Science class to expand upon my computer science background. Additionally I’ve been working with a team of friends to create an analytics tracking bot that works as a web app. I take pride in paying attention to every detail, like how well a program runs, and making every project the best it can be. I love working to develop new solutions, as every project is an opportunity to better myself by learning something new.</p>
